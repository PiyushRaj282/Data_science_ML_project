## 🗂️ Project Structure

* `Online_advertising_performance.ipynb` – Main notebook with data analysis and model
* `requirements.txt` – List of required Python packages
* `data/` – Folder to store datasets
* `outputs/` – Folder for graphs and model results

## ⚡ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PiyushRaj282/Data_science_ML_project.git
   cd Data_science_ML_project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Add your dataset to the `data/` folder.

4. Open and run `Online_advertising_performance.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.

## 📊 Dataset

Contains information related to ad campaigns:

* Impressions
* Clicks
* Conversions
* Cost

*(Place your dataset file in the `data/` folder before running the notebook.)*

---

## 🎯 Model

* Algorithm: Simple Regression Model
* Evaluated using:

  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  * R² Score

---

## 📈 Visualizations

* Data distribution plots
* Correlation heatmap
* Actual vs Predicted graph

*(Results are saved in the `outputs/` folder.)*

---

## 🚀 Future Work

* Try advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Build a web app for predictions
